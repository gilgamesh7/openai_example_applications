"Classify the sentiment in these reviews for the movie Last Action Hero:\n\n
1. If there's one thing going for "Last Action Hero" (not counting Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course), it's the construction of it all. Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy (meet PG-13 hero Austin O'Brien) and adult shoot'em-up, Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns, doesn't completely bowl you over, it's clever and intriguing.
At least, mostly. This Other Big Summer Movie, this rival to "Jurassic Park," is not seamless. Structurally, it can be a little haphazard and messy. The humor sometimes hits, sometimes misses. It'll depend on what mood the audience is in. A 7:30 crowd could roll in the aisles over this; but the 9:45 folks might sit through this stunned. It's that kind of movie. But if "Action Hero" has its dead spots, it can also be funny -- very funny. Take Arnold playing Hamlet . . . .
But first, the story. Eleven-year-old Danny (O'Brien) has only one respite from dangerous New York City life and school: To watch his favorite movie hero, Jack Slater. Thanks to friendly, old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky), he can slip into the theater day or night to watch Slater in celluloid action.
Slater (played by Maria Shriver's muscular Austrian sidekick) is an L. A. cop who chews a mean cigar, walks unharmed through gunfire and always gets his man. Naturally he does this with enormous infrastructural damage, vehicular destruction, stunt heroics and gratuitous loss of life. His screen life is a swaggering, fictional blast. And watching alone in the theater, Danny drinks it all in.
Things get interesting when projectionist Nick gives Danny a magic movie ticket -- given to him years ago by Harry Houdini. The old man, who has never dared use it, finally tears it in half and hands the stub to Danny. Clutching the ticket, Danny finds himself transported into Slater's world. In the midst of a frenetic car chase, Slater is shocked to find an 11-year-old sitting in the back of his car.
First, it's Danny's turn to be in Slater's world. A veteran of Slater's movies, he knows every cliche, every heroic one-liner and all of Slater's history. A hero-and-the-kid story develops, as Danny helps Slater contend with his latest villains (played by Anthony Quinn and Charles Dance). But all hell breaks loose when Benedict (Dance) gets hold of the magic ticket and enters Danny's world. Now, Danny brings Slater into the real world, and the movie hero discovers it really hurts when you punch through glass.
At this point, director John "Die Hard" McTiernan and his team of scriptwriters (a conspiracy of four, collectively responsible for "Lethal Weapon," "The Last Boy Scout" and "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane") have their multidimensional work cut out for them. Whether these convolutions are too involved for summer audiences remains to be seen. But story momentum is often lost. The drama doesn't keep you gripped the way "Terminator II: Judgment Day" did -- or that far superior dimension-fusion fantasy, "Back to the Future."
"Action Hero," with multiple cameos from Sharon Stone, Hammer, Jean-Claude Van Damme and a myriad others, has a quorum of good moments -- and more than enough of Arnold -- to satisfy the crowd. As for those smart-alecky lines, they come at you like frenzied bullets, hoping desperately to connect. Some are better than others. "Could I speak to the drug dealer of the house?" asks Slater sweetly, when villain Dance opens his mansion door. Danny also has an amusing daydream at the beginning, when he pictures Slater as Hamlet in an action-movie version of the play: "Something's rotten in the State of Denmark," says the announcer in the imaginary movie trailer. "And Hamlet is taking out the trash!" Perhaps that was the movie Arnold should have done.
2. Trying to be everything to everybody rarely, if ever, works, and Last Action Hero is a textbook case in point. Borrowing heavily from Woody Allen's Purple Rose of Cairo, professional action director McTiernan has crafted a massive juggernaut of a film, overflowing with breathtaking stunts, witty one-liners, and well-chosen cameos. It's a film with so much promise, you just want to hunt down everybody involved when you realize it doesn't deliver the goods. Twelve-year-old New Yorker Danny Madigan (O'Brien) is a movie buff engrossed in the “Jack Slater” series of action films. Slater, a fictional cross between Bruce Willis, Van Damme, Sly Stallone, and others, is the sort of film character Schwarzenegger was born to play -- it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. When Danny receives a magic ticket at a private screening of Jack Slater IV, he finds himself catapulted through the screen and into Slater's “reality,” a place where all the women are California knockouts, the good guys always win, and you can't say four-letter words because “this movie's PG-13.” Director McTiernan uses this alternate world as a means to poke fun at Schwarzenegger's rugged persona and that of action films in general. In-jokes flow like Tinseltown dollars here -- in one brief shot, Danny spies both Sharon Stone and an evil-looking Robert Patrick (Schwarzenegger's robotic foe in last summer's Terminator 2) exiting the opulent LAPD headquarters just as he's walking in with Slater. And upon first seeing Slater's friend Practice, played by F. Murray Abraham, Danny exclaims, “You'd better keep your eye on that guy. He killed Mozart.” When villainous killer Benedict (Charles Dance, in perhaps the film's best role) manages to get his hands on Danny's magic ticket, the film jumps back to the “real” world climax, and to the NYC premiere of Jack Slater IV, complete with cameos from the “real” Schwarzenegger and wife Maria Shriver, Chevy Chase, Jean-Claude Van Damme, et al. Really, it's not as confusing as it sounds, and, unfortunately, it's also not nearly as good as it sounds, either. Slater/Schwarzenegger's quips wear thin in the film's first half-hour, and even McTiernan's Player-esque stabs at skewering his own stock-in-trade fall flat way too often. At the nearly-packed screening I attended, there seemed to be far more babies crying than people laughing in the audience -- a sure sign that something's amiss. The film tries so very hard to be The Movie of Summer '93 that it almost makes you sick for what could have been, what should have been, and, in the end, what it is: soulless sound and fury -- action in a vacuum.
3. It's not a bomb at all. A dud is more like it - Last Action Hero isn't interesting enough to be explosively bad. For all the inflated pyrotechnics on the screen, the picture seems consistently grey and almost pitiably small.
4. The script is weak and unrelenting. The stunts are unspectacular. The special effects are nothing you haven't seen before. But worst of all, there's the spectacle of Schwarzenegger glorying in the wonder of Schwarzenegger. 
5. Last Action Hero starts out mostly nuts, and winds up mostly bolts. Or, rather, winds down. That's a problem with pastiche: it must be constantly jump-started with ingenuity, and even that ultimately pales. By the end, nothing matters.
6. Last Action Hero is sporadically entertaining, but it could have been a whole lot more. Trimmed down and better edited, this film might have been a top-notch satire. As it is, however, it gets caught someplace in between action and comedy, and never really comes across as a solid example of either.
7. Last Action Hero is something of a mess, but a frequently enjoyable one. It tries to be too many things to too many different kinds of audiences, the result being that it will probably confuse, and perhaps even alienate, the hard-core action fans.
